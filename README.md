# Misc
Python program that creates an AppIcon folder for an iOS app. All you have to do is put this file in the same folder as the image you want to use for your app icon, name the Logo.png, and execute the python program. It will create a folder and make a bunch of duplicates of your image, with the appropriate sizes. Then just copy and past the JSON file, above, into the folder AppIcon.appiconset (don't forget to update the version to match your app's version). Now you can just copy and paste it into your Assets.xcassets folder of your XCode App and viola!
